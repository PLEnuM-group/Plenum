# PLENUM
This repository contains code that aims to 
show the potential of a global neutrino telescope network.
Potential analyses are illustrated in the available notebooks.

The basic assumption of this study is, that all new telescopes 
included in the so-called PLENUM network behave similar to IceCube.
With these notebooks the neutrino point source discovery potential 
of arbitrary detector networks can be tested and even new detector 
locations could be motivated.

The notebooks and the tools require numpy, scipy, healpy and astropy.
