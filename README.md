# PLENUM
This repository contains several notebooks that aim to 
show the potential of a global neutrino telescope network.

The basic assumption of this study is, that all new telescopes 
included in the so-called PLENUM network behave similar to IceCube.
With these notebooks the neutrino point source discovery potential 
of arbitrary detector networks can be tested and even new detector 
locations could be motivated.

The notebooks and the tools require numpy, scipy, healpy and astropy.
